First step was to plan out what was required and what I needed to make happen by using psuedocode which I went  over its accepted standards through with Dyon the TA.
## Step One Variables
Once I planned out what I needed to do I started to code using variables and putting each element inside an array.
Second step was to create a prompt and confirm's asking the user what characters they need in their password.  I stumbled accross a Stack Overflow page where a programmer already had this setup.  I decided to copy and paste the code and in a multiline comment explain where I obtained the piece of code and what the code does.

## Step Two generate Password function
Next I ended up with a 150 line conditional loop going through every possible condition to get the exact output the user wanted.  However, this proved to be ugly and was a too complicated solution which would likely result in bugs.  Thus I decided to retry, by looking at the example which I grabbed the confirm segment from.  I then followed the link to rando.js which is a programmed script to help randomise elemnts depending on the element type.  After several trials I was able to work it to the result I wanted.

Once all of this was completed I put it all inside of the generate function and worked as I logged each step to the console for finding errors and debugging.

## Step Three
At this point I was frustrated at not being able to get the code to display it on screen so with the help from a Learning BCS tool through slack I was able to get the assistance of an instructor to assist me in finishing off the code by adding a return Passphrase at the end of the function and correcting line 14 to have it display.

### Additional Comments
I found this particular assignment stressful as we were expected to research code about functions without knowing what to specifically look for cuasing extra stress and depressional states which was not fun this past week.  However, I soldiered on and if I had more time I would try to look into if conditions to ensure a minimum of one element would appear in the code if more time allowed.  But I need to review other material to stay on course of the workflow.  I enjoyed the challenge and thrill despite the pain it caused and I have a greater understanding of why One needs to be careful when coding to avoid unnecessary bugs.
